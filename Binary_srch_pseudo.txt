Binary Search

Procedure: binary_search (x: integer; A1,A2,....,An: increasing integers)

i: 1 {i is left endpoint of Search interval}
j: n {j is the right endpoint of search interval}

while i < j
begin 
    m := ((i+j)/2)  {m is the point in the middle}
    if x > Am then i:m+1
    else j:= m
end
if x= Ai then location:= i
else location:= 0

{location is the subscript of the term that equals x, or it is 0 if x is not found}
